# Code Efficiency Analysis Report

## Summary
This report identifies multiple efficiency issues in the tanner-moss.github.io repository that impact performance, maintainability, and user experience.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Files (FIXED)
- **Issue**: `tabscript.js` referenced in index.html but doesn't exist (404 error)
- **Impact**: JavaScript errors, broken tab functionality
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Created missing file

### 2. Duplicate Code (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Tab functionality duplicated in homescript.js and referenced as separate file
- **Impact**: Code maintenance burden, larger file sizes
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Separated into proper files

### 3. Duplicate CSS Rules (FIXED)
- **Issue**: `.scroll-container` defined twice in homestyle.css (lines 350-359 and 368-378)
- **Impact**: Larger CSS file, potential styling conflicts
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Removed duplicate

### 4. Large Unoptimized Images (RECOMMENDED)
- **Issue**: Repository contains 146MB of assets, including:
  - wildlife.mp4 (24MB)
  - map4.png (7.9MB)
  - Multiple PNG files over 1MB each
- **Impact**: Slow page load times, high bandwidth usage
- **Recommendation**: Compress images, convert to WebP format, implement lazy loading

### 5. Malformed HTML (RECOMMENDED)
- **Issue**: ageofwar.html contains completely duplicate HTML structure
- **Issue**: certs.html has trailing malformed content
- **Impact**: Invalid HTML, potential rendering issues
- **Recommendation**: Fix HTML structure

### 6. Mixed Styling Approaches (RECOMMENDED)
- **Issue**: Inline styles mixed with external CSS across multiple files
- **Impact**: Harder maintenance, larger HTML files
- **Recommendation**: Consolidate styles into external CSS files

### 7. Missing Background Image (IDENTIFIED)
- **Issue**: artpage.html references "stars.jpg" which doesn't exist
- **Impact**: Broken background animation
- **Recommendation**: Add missing image or update reference

## Performance Impact
- Fixed 404 error improves page load reliability
- Removed duplicate CSS reduces file size by ~10 lines
- Separated JavaScript improves code organization and caching

## Files Modified
- Created: `tabscript.js` - Contains tab switching functionality
- Modified: `homescript.js` - Removed duplicate tab code
- Modified: `homestyle.css` - Removed duplicate CSS rules
- Created: `EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md` - This report

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify tab functionality works correctly
2. Check browser console for 404 errors (should be resolved)
3. Confirm CSS styling remains intact
4. Test responsive design on mobile devices

## Future Improvements
1. Image optimization (could reduce repository size by 80%+)
2. HTML validation and cleanup
3. CSS consolidation and minification
4. JavaScript bundling and minification
5. Implement lazy loading for images
6. Add missing background images
